## Conceitos preliminares

### Keywords and identifiers

Some tokens, called reserved keywords, have special meaning:

* for, while, do, . . .
* int, char, const, . . .
* See more in <https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/keyword>

Identifiers are sequences of case-sensitive letters, digits and underscores that are not keywords
and are not started with a digit. They name the entities in the program:
* sum, i, j, . . .
* *very_big_identifier, . . .
* printf, scanf, . . .
* More in <https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/identifiers>
It is important to use identifiers that are meaningful and conventional!

### Data types

Objects, functions, and expressions have a property called type, which determines the
interpretation of the binary value stored in an object or evaluated by the expression
(https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/type):
* void
* char
* signed integers: signed char, short, int, long, long long
* unsigned integers: bool, unsigned char, unsigned short, unsigned int, unsigned long,
unsigned long long
* real floating: float, double, long double
* enumerated: enum class
* derived: array ([]), structure (struct), union (union), function, pointer (*)

### Variables and objects

Variables are special objects. Objects are regions of data storage in the execution environment
with a value. Every variable has:
* an identifier that denotes this object
* a size
* a storage duration/lifetime (automatic, static, allocated, thread-local)
* an effective type
* a value (which may be indeterminate)

### Declarations and definitions

Before we write the “commands” we want to run, we must declare and define the entities of the
program. (<https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/declarations>)

Declaration:
* introduces one or more identifiers into the program
* specifies their meaning and properties
* may appear in any scope
* declaration ends with a semicolon
* consists of specifiers, qualifiers, declarators, and initializers
* can introduce the same identifier in some cases (redeclaration)

Definition
* is a declaration that provides all information about the identifiers it declares

Examples:
1 void foo (); // declaration of function foo
2 void foo (); // redeclaration of function foo
3
4 extern int bar ; // declaration of variable bar
5
6 int main () { // definition of function main
7 int baz ; // definition of variable baz
8 const double pi = 3.1415; // definition with initializer
9 }
10
11 int bar = 1; // definition of variable bar

Obs: Evite usar variáveis globais.
