## Conceitos preliminares

### Keywords and identifiers

Some tokens, called reserved keywords, have special meaning:

* for, while, do, . . .
* int, char, const, . . .
* See more in <https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/keyword>

Identifiers are sequences of case-sensitive letters, digits and underscores that are not keywords
and are not started with a digit. They name the entities in the program:
* sum, i, j, . . .
* very_big_identifier, . . .
* printf, scanf, . . .
* More in <https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/identifiers>
It is important to use identifiers that are meaningful and conventional!

### Data types

Objects, functions, and expressions have a property called type, which determines the
interpretation of the binary value stored in an object or evaluated by the expression
(https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/type):
* void
* char
* signed integers: signed char, short, int, long, long long
* unsigned integers: bool, unsigned char, unsigned short, unsigned int, unsigned long, unsigned long long
* real floating: float, double, long double
* enumerated: enum class
* derived: array ([]), structure (struct), union (union), function, pointer (*)

### Variables and objects

Variables are special objects. Objects are regions of data storage in the execution environment
with a value. Every variable has:
* an identifier that denotes this object
* a size
* a storage duration/lifetime (automatic, static, allocated, thread-local)
* an effective type
* a value (which may be indeterminate)

### Declarations and definitions

Before we write the “commands” we want to run, we must declare and define the entities of the program. (<https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/declarations>)

Declaration:
* introduces one or more identifiers into the program
* specifies their meaning and properties
* may appear in any scope
* declaration ends with a semicolon
* consists of specifiers, qualifiers, declarators, and initializers
* can introduce the same identifier in some cases (redeclaration)

Definition
* is a declaration that provides all information about the identifiers it declares

Examples:

~~~c++
1 void foo (); // declaration of function foo
2 void foo (); // redeclaration of function foo
3
4 extern int bar ; // declaration of variable bar
5
6 int main () { // definition of function main
7 int baz ; // definition of variable baz
8 const double pi = 3.1415; // definition with initializer
9 }
10
11 int bar = 1; // definition of variable bar
~~~
Obs: Evite usar variáveis globais.

### Expressions

Most of the calculations and operations in a program are done via expressions (<https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language/expressions>).

Expressions:
* are sequences of primary expressions (identifier, literals, etc)
* binds the primary expressions using operators
* have a value
* have a type

Examples:

~~~c++
1 int main () {
2 // (1 + 10) is an expression with value 10 and type int
3 int a = 1 + 10;
4
5 // expression with identifier printf , literal " Hello ",
6 // combined with operator ()
7 // the value of the expression is the return of printf
8 // which has type int
9 std :: cout << " Hello !\n";
10 }
~~~

### Operators

| assignment | increment | arithmetic | logical | comparison | member access |  other  |
| ---------- | --------- | ---------- | ------- | ---------- | ------------- | ------- |
|   a = b    |           |     +a     |         |            |               |         |
|   a += b   |           |     -a     |         |            |               |         |
|   a -= b   |           |    a + b   |         |            |               |         |
|   a *= b   |    ++a    |    a - b   |         |   a == b   |               |         |
|   a/= b    |    --a    |    a * b   |         |   a != b   |      a[b]     | a(...)  | 
|   a %= b   |    a++    |    a / b   |    !a   |   a < b    |       *a      |   a, b  |
|   a &= b   |    a--    |    a % b   |  a && b |   a > b    |       &a      |(type) a |
| a "|"= b   |           |     ~a     | a `||` b|   a <= b   |      a->b     |  a?b:c  |
|   a ^= b   |           |    a & b   |         |   a >= b   |       a.b     |sizeof a |
|   a <<= b  |           |   a `|` b  |         |            |               |         |
|   a >>= b  |           |    a ^b    |         |            |               |         |
|            |           |   a << b   |         |            |               |         |
|            |           |   a >> b   |         |            |               |         |
